0               This tests the call, saving a literal into
0               the subroutine and returning that litteral back to main


4 2             Make room for literals in main
22 0 50         put 50 into cell 0
3 0             push contents of cell 0 (50) onto new stack
2 1001          call subroutine at label 1001
6 1             puts the return value (-50) into stack cell 1
35              debug code to show stack and heap
26              end program

0               At this point, stack should be BP[ 0, 0, 50, -50 ]SP
0               Heap should be empty

1 1001          start of subroutine
4 1             gives extra room in stack frame for local var
21 1 0          Negate cell 0 and save it in 1 (-50)
5 1             give the contents of cell 1 (-50) for return
